**OSI Model**

**Simplified Framework**
Layers 1-3 (Network Support Layers): Concerned with moving data around, covering everything from the physical aspects of connectivity to routing data across complex networks.
Layers 4-6 (Transport Layers): Focus on delivering data reliably and efficiently, including establishing connections, maintaining sessions, and ensuring data is correctly formatted and error-free.
Layer 7 (Application Layer): Focuses on the actual content being transmitted. It's where user-interface software and network services reside, defining the data that users or applications need to communicate over the network.

**Details**
1. Physical e.g. Ethernet
2. Data link e.g. Ethernet 802.xx
3. Network e.g. IP
4. Transport e.g. TCP
5. Session e.g. Sockets
6. Presentation e.g. TLS & SSL
7. Application e.g. HTTP
