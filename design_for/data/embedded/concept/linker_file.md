**Linker file**

**Definition**
Describes how sections of the code and data (like text, data and bss etc.) are mapped to memory. 

**Uses**
* Especially important in embedded systems programming where memory resources are limited.

**Debugging**
* Map files can be used to see how the linker file has actually mapped the memory - although dynamic memory allocation is invisible to the map file
