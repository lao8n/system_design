1. The bit size of the CPU decides how many bytes of data it can access in RAM memory at the same time. A 16-bit CPU can access 2 bytes (with each byte consisting of 8 bit) while a 64-bit CPU can access 8 bytes at a time.

2. The processing speed of the CPU is measured in Gigahertz or Megahertz and denotes the number of operations it can perform in one second.
