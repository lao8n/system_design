**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

**Definition**:

**Key properties**
* Connectionless: Does not establish a connection before sending data packets and does not maintain a connection state.
* Unreliable: Does not guarantee delivery of data packets or their order, providing no error checking or recovery mechanisms.
* Lightweight: Has lower overhead due to the absence of connection setup and maintenance.

**Useful for**
Suitable for scenarios where low latency and high throughput are crucial, and where packet loss is acceptable, such as in video streaming, online gaming, and VoIP.
